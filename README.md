# Matrix-Multiplication
Multiplication of two matrices using threads to optimize the performance.
Three functions are implemented to get the result of multiplying two matrices.
1. Brute Force algorithm without using threads.
2. Version1: The computation of each element of the output matrix happens in a thread.
3. Version2: The computation of each row of the output matrix happens in a thread.
